# 🌱 Smart Plant Care Assistant

Smart Plant Care Assistant is a full stack web application built with one simple thought in mind 🌿 plants cannot speak, but their condition always tells a story. This project helps users understand that story in a clear and honest way.

Most tools give generic advice. This one explains what is happening, why it is happening, and what should be done next 🤍

## 🌼 What This Project Is Really About

The application allows users to upload an image of their plant through a clean and simple web interface 📷  
Once uploaded, the system studies the plant condition and turns that information into something meaningful.

It does not just give results. It gives reasoning.

## 🌿 What the User Sees

🌱 A clear health score that reflects how the plant is doing
